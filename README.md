# Immersive Ores

Immersive Ores add three new ores to the game, Vibranium, Vulpus and Enderium, with the aim of improving the cave and mining experience

Vibranium Ore: Can be found in the Overworld
Vulpus Ore: Can be found in the Nether
Enderium Ore: Can be found in the End

Every Ore adds new armor, tools and special tools, such as paxel, hammer and excavators!
And to create the next armor you will need the previous one

                                           Vibranium Armor -> Vulpus Armor -> Enderium Armor
